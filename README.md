# 🍁 BinaryFetch-CLI based fully customizable system information tool 
An advanced Windows system information fetcher written in C++ — featuring self-healing configuration, modular architecture, compact & detailed modes, and extreme customization.

Built for Windows. Built to last. Built to be shared.


## ✨ Key Philosophy

> **Simplicity is the priority.**

* Two user-editable files
* Self-healing engine
* Modular, scalable design
* Clean separation between *data*, *logic*, and *presentation*




## 🚀 What Makes BinaryFetch Different?

### 🧠 Engine-First Design

BinaryFetch guarantees that **the program never crashes due to missing user files**.

If a user:

* deletes `BinaryArt.txt`
* deletes `BinaryFetch_Config.json`
* corrupts configuration
* runs BinaryFetch for the first time

👉 **The engine automatically recreates everything from defaults.**

No prompts.
No errors.
No user intervention.

## 🗂️ User Customization (Only 2 Files)
you can modify and customize them safely from,

`C:\Users\Default\AppData\Local\BinaryFetch\`
| File               | Purpose                         |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| `BinaryArt.txt`    | User ASCII art (fully editable, copy-paste-done !) |
| `BinaryFetch_Config.json` | Module configuration & layout   |

That’s it.

No profiles.
No databases.
No complex formats.
## Color Code System

### And also you can customize each character's Color of your `BinaryArt.txt`

Use `$n` in your `BinaryArt.txt` file where `n` is the color number:

| Code | Color | ANSI Code | Code | Color | ANSI Code |
|------|-------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| `$1` | Red | `\033[31m` | `$8` | Bright Red | `\033[91m` |
| `$2` | Green | `\033[32m` | `$9` | Bright Green | `\033[92m` |
| `$3` | Yellow | `\033[33m` | `$10` | Bright Yellow | `\033[93m` |
| `$4` | Blue | `\033[34m` | `$11` | Bright Blue | `\033[94m` |
| `$5` | Magenta | `\033[35m` | `$12` | Bright Magenta | `\033[95m` |
| `$6` | Cyan | `\033[36m` | `$13` | Bright Cyan | `\033[96m` |
| `$7` | White | `\033[37m` | `$14` | Bright White | `\033[97m` |
|      |       |           | `$15` | Reset | `\033[0m` |

### Color Code Examples

**Single color per line:**
```
$1⠀⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿
```
Output: Entire line in red

**Multiple colors per line:**
```
$2⠀⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿
```
Output: Green → Yellow → Red

**No color (default white):**
```
⠀⠀⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿
```
Output: Standard white text

## 🧬 Compact Mode

BinaryFetch includes a **Compact Mode** for clean, readable output.

Example:

```
[OS]      -> Windows 11 10.0 (Build 22631) (64-bit)
[CPU]     -> Ryzen 5 5600G (6C/12T) @ 3.89 GHz
[GPU]     -> RTX 4070 SUPER (9%) (11.99 GB)
[Memory]  -> 47.79 GB (Free: 28.44 GB) (40%)
[Display] -> 2 Monitors @ 60Hz
[User]    -> @coffee~ (Admin)
```

Each compact section is powered by **dedicated lightweight classes** (`CompactCPU`, `CompactGPU`, etc.).

## 🛡️ Self-Healing Engine (Worst-Case Handling)

BinaryFetch **never breaks** due to user mistakes.

### Automatic Recovery Includes:

* Missing ASCII art file → recreated from bundled default
* Missing JSON config → recreated from default schema
* Deleted directories → recreated silently
* Corrupted config → safely regenerated

> **Main never manages files. The engine does everything.**
