# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as contributors and maintainers of **BinaryFetch**, pledge to make participation in this project a respectful, inclusive, and welcoming experience for everyone — especially newcomers.

We believe open-source grows best when people are encouraged to learn, ask questions, and improve without fear of ridicule.

## Our Standards

We value the following behaviors:

- Welcoming contributors of all skill levels, including first-time contributors  
- Treating beginners with patience, kindness, and respect  
- Offering constructive, respectful feedback  
- Helping others learn from mistakes instead of criticizing them  
- Focusing on collaboration, growth, and shared learning  

Unacceptable behavior includes:

- Laughing at, mocking, or disrespecting newcomers or beginners  
- Harassment, discrimination, or hateful conduct of any kind  
- Personal attacks, insults, or hostile language  
- Shaming others for mistakes, lack of knowledge, or experience level  
- Any behavior that discourages healthy participation  

## Mistakes Are Normal

Making mistakes is a natural part of learning.

If someone makes a mistake:
- We address it respectfully  
- We explain the issue clearly and kindly  
- We help them understand how to improve  

Public shaming, sarcasm, or disrespectful reactions are not acceptable.
