# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, **level of experience**, education, socio-economic
status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We especially recognize that **newcomers and beginners are an essential part
of a healthy open-source community**.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Helping newcomers learn and grow, even when mistakes are made
* Treating beginner mistakes as learning opportunities, not failures
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* Laughing at, mocking, or disrespecting beginners or newcomers
* Shaming others for mistakes, lack of knowledge, or experience level
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Any conduct that discourages participation through fear, ridicule, or hostility

## Mistakes Are Normal

Mistakes are a natural part of learning.

If someone makes a mistake, we are expected to:
* Address the issue respectfully
* Explain the mistake clearly and calmly
* Help them understand how to improve

Public shaming, sarcasm, or disrespectful reactions are not acceptable.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including but not
limited to GitHub issues, pull requests, discussions, and comments.
It also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in
public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
The privacy and security of reporters will be respected.
